I've stored a few of the TI-84 programs that I used frequently in school. To upload these to your calculator, you will need to download the free [TI Connect CE software](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw) which is available from education.ti.com.
All programs were written natively on a TI-84 Plus Silver Edition.
